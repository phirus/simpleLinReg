simpleLinReg
============

very simple linear Regression tool for testing 

uses Google Test: http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

to run the tests, the values LIB and INC in the test/makefile need to be the location of the gtest library and include files

if you want to use another compiler than clang, you need to change the coresponding entry in the makefile
